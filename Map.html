            <p><strong>Partnership Overview:</strong> <strong>Henkel CSR Plan in France</strong></p>
            <p>Committed together to prepare for tomorrow today!</p>
            <p>Since 2014, a group of volunteer employees, from different branches and functions, has been at the initiative of an innovative social project: 
            <strong>L'Arrondi solidaire</strong>, made on the basis of micro-donations on salary (the cents of the rounding down to the nearest Euro).</p>
            <p>Supported by the company, each micro-donation made by employees is matched up to 100% by Henkel. All of this is donated to social projects 
            implemented by the Secours populaire fran√ßais and to the "SOS Taudis" project of the Abb√© Pierre Foundation.</p>
            <p>Taking up the principle <strong>"together, small streams make great rivers"</strong>, this project was designed with microDON, a social and solidarity 
            company that aims to allow everyone (employees, consumers) to make very simple micro-donations from a few cents to a few euros (rounding up on salary, 
            rounding up in cash) for the benefit of associations.</p>

            <p><strong>Partnership Overview:</strong> In October 2024, Dixan launched the project "In His Steps: Alongside and in the shoes of those who live in hygiene poverty" with a short film, a dedicated landing page, and social activations. 
            The short film, developed in collaboration with CESVI, was presented as a touching social experiment aimed at highlighting the theme of hygiene poverty and the social barriers that follow. 
            The project is part of Dixan's commitment with CESVI to raise public awareness of hygiene poverty, a situation that affects about 10% of Italian families.</p>

            The Food Bank collects the surpluses of the agri-food chain to save them from waste and, at the same time, help the most needy.</p>
